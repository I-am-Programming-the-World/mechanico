## UI Modernization (This patch)

- Added **Lalezar** display font and Tailwind `font-display` utility.
- Tightened **top nav** item spacing and ensured single-line layout with `whitespace-nowrap` and responsive gaps.
- Ensured **Tabs** lists align to the right (`justify-end`) and content respects RTL.
- Introduced a **Recharts** wrapper (`components/ui/chart.tsx`) with theme-friendly container and tooltip.
- Kept everything **RTL-first**; global `dir="rtl"` styling reinforced in CSS.

## Additional fixes and enhancements (2025-10-11)

- Resolved multiple **build failures** caused by incomplete JSX in event handlers (`onClick=`). All action buttons now properly call their corresponding handlers (e.g.
  `handleAddInventoryItem`, `handleCreateBooking`, `handleSave`, etc.) and unnecessary placeholder loading states have been removed.
- Corrected malformed JSX in **navigation components**. The mobile menu button and overflow menu in `SmartNav` now properly wrap children and no longer inject elements inside attribute declarations.
- Updated **Layout** logout button to call a `handleLogout` helper instead of an empty `onClick` and fixed nested `<NavLink>` structure for mobile navigation.
- Added **Vazirmatn** and **Lalezar** font imports to `index.html` to ensure the defined fonts are actually loaded. Inter now serves only as a fallback via system fonts.
- Fixed various **user management** pages (Inventory, Bookings, Vehicles, Users, Employees, Accounting, Services, Settings, Auth) by replacing placeholder event handlers with functional logic and ensuring all forms submit correctly. Approval, deletion, and adjustment actions now work as expected.
- Aligned all interactive controls to respect **RTL and right-aligned** layouts, removed stray English placeholders, and cleaned up aria labels for accessibility.
